# Tableau Demos Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Tableau demo projects built with synthetic datasets. Each project is designed to replicate real-world BI use cases and highlight key skills in data preparation, visualization, KPI tracking, and dashboard storytelling.

## Structure
Each project is organized as a folder under the repo root.

Inside each project:
- **data/** → contains raw and processed datasets (CSV)  
- **workbook/** → contains Tableau packaged workbooks (.twbx) ready to open  
- **README.txt** → documents project purpose, dataset details, and dashboard features  
- **<DASHBOARD_NAME>.pdf** → documents project purpose, dataset details, and dashboard features  (if applicable)
- **<DASHBOARD_NAME-Presentation>.pdf** → documents project purpose, dataset details, and dashboard features  (if applicable)

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to showcase BI and analytics capabilities for portfolio and interview purposes. Projects demonstrate how to:
- Start from raw data and reconcile it into a clean reporting dataset  
- Create calculated fields and KPIs such as ROI, ROAS, CTR, Conversion Rate  
- Build executive-style dashboards with interactivity and drilldowns  
- Present insights for stakeholders across marketing, sales, and operations  

## Usage
1. Clone the repo locally.  
2. Open any project folder and explore the dataset in **data/**.  
3. Open the `.twbx` file in Tableau Public Desktop to view and interact with the dashboard.  
4. Some dashboards may also be available via Tableau Public links for quick preview.  

## Future Work
This repo will continue to grow with additional demo dashboards covering different BI scenarios such as finance, operations, and customer analytics.
